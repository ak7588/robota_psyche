# April 26

I haven't yet had a chance to finish the reading entirely, but here are a few discussion points that came to my mind so far:

1. The command to "lose yourself", in addition to the flawed perception of the three laws of robotics, reminded me of the second story in _I, Robot_, in which a robot was told to get something for people but instead didn't and acted as if it were "drunk". If it's so easy to miscommand a robot, how do we really know that their perception of our task is correct?
2. We have discussed in class that artistic robots are different in their essence from military or any other industrial robots. Should robots that are ought to protect humans or perform other dangerous tasks undergo special provision that ensures there're no "bugs" to their robotic-laws?
