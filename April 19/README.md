# _Reason_ by A.Asimov

This has been an interesting read to me as it sparked some discussion (in my head) on limitations of human knowledge.

I have read a similar sci-fi novel by Stanislaw Lem called _Solaris_, in which human scientists were powerless when discovering a new planet with an intelligent life that humankind never knew about. I thought that Asimov and Lem were close in delivering the following message: _we can't know what we don't know_. We might be good at predicting some phenomena, but eventually we might have no idea for the "why" behind them.

Two years ago scientists have created a deep [learning model](https://medium.com/the-cosmic-companion/first-ai-model-of-the-universe-knows-science-it-was-never-taught-cd8388564f8c) to simulate space, the Deep Density Displacement Model (D3M).

The model has developed to the extent that its own creators don't fully understand how it works. In Asimov's _Reason_, the robot serves to prove the same point about the future of technology.
