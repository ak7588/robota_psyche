# *I, Robot*
I have really enjoyed starting Isaac Asimov's "*I, Robot*" -- it was a nice break from all of the research and other academic papers to focus on science fiction. Some of the topics that it prompted me to think about:
- Why do we hesitate to trust robots/AI even though it **is** better than humans in some areas?
- Do robots really have to "serve" human needs for us to see their value / appreciate them?
- Can robots just exist for the sake of existence and not serving?
- If empathy is programmed (Robbie), is it real?
- It was interesting to read about robotics' social construct in *Runaround*, and I am curious -- how this behavior will look like in robot-to-robot interaction?
