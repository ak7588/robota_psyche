# Final Project Ideas

I am still unsure whether I would like to write some code or a paper, but here are some of the ideas:

- ### Processing

Create an environment with campus cats and birds. Some of the cats will be orange and aggressive, so the birds will have to avoid them. Some birds might get hurt and die, while some new cats are born.

- ### Paper

Discussion of robotic representation in popular media and ethics behind it.
