# Campus Cats Adventure

April 28, 2021.

Campus Cats Adventure is an arcade game that is based on NYU Abu Dhabi campus environment.
A number of cats are wondering around the virtual "campus", and the player's task is to collect as many student ID's as possible.
The game gets more difficult with an increasing score.
If the player's health gets below zero, the game is over.

## Final Project Idea

Create an environment with campus cats and a player (student). Some of the cats will be orange and aggressive, so the player has to avoid them. The player is the center of the flow field, so aggressive cats are naturally attracted to the player. The player has health points and if all of them are gone, the game is over.
