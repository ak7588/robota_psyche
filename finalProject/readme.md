# Final Project Ideas

Create an environment with campus cats and a player (student). Some of the cats will be orange and aggressive, so the player has to avoid them. The player is the center of the flow field, so aggressive cats are naturally attracted to the player. The player has health points and if all of them are gone, the game is over.
