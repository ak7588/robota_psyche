# Final Project Journal

## April 17:

- Downloaded and cropped cat images to embed into the program.
- Downloaded the aggressive meow sound to play whenever the aggressive cat is met.
- Started the code: implemented the GUI and the Cat, FlowField, and PLayer Classes.

Next steps:

- Add some new features to the Cat class to follow the Player flowfield.

## April 19:
- Fixed bugs in the detect collision function (problem was in the booleans detecting prevState)

## April 21:
- Implemented the followMouse() flow field method in the FlowField class and added followFlowField() method to the Cat class.
